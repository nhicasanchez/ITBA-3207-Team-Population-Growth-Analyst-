In our day today, we should be always focused and aware on our medical condition, on our health. Most of Filipinos are used to take those vaccines to be prepared and secured in the challenges of this COVID PANDEMIC. But how about the pregnant? How they can be secured? It’s a matter life and how to be safe. And also most of the pregnant doesn’t recognized to take those vaccines, they don’t want this vaccine to harmed the baby in their womb. According to Fernando Mariz, MD — Written by Lia Tabackman and the Healthline Editorial Team — Updated on October 22, 2021 “ At your first visit, your doctor will check your vital signs and take your medical history.

This article tells that having a proper appointment with your pregnancy clinic will help every mother to secure the condition of their babies, but how did they able to do that, if this pandemic case will still bind in our environment? Then technology should take the responsibility to resolve this problem. Growth and development may lead us into better places that which may we apply it in our daily lifestyle.

The biggest problem discussed in this study is the continuous increase in the number of population in the Philippines. Reasons why this happens, or who is often the victim of such a situation. Whether Filipinos are still able to maintain their safety even though they are pregnant despite the severity caused by the pandemic. The study focused on some specific areas.

**Significance Of The Proposed Project** 
##


The importance of this project is basically focused on its specific subject which is the mother and baby in her womb. First of all, as a project developer we all consider things to be favored in both parties, but the main concerns here are the safeties of every pregnant mommy’s who wants to do and to get the results of their pregnancy check-up’s during this pandemic. Proper accommodation and service will lead everyone to go with a right process, and this project can make it by using a real-time basis for appointment list. Because of this COVID PANDEMIC we all know that a lot of us was trying to set a good term of allowance budgeting to survive in daily needs, that’s how this project can help also every mommy’s, because this system can access online then basically they don’t need to go to clinic personally just to pass their requirements for checkups, very time and budget saving.

We should be aware on the growth of technologies; we should accept the fact that we are in a modern era that everything can be manipulated and controlled by computer automation. We need to accept the fact that manual process can make it better if we pursue to upgrade it

**METHODS**
##
The primary issue of this research is to how to help our society be open to health issues and population growth and According to Esperanza Cabral Secretary of Health, Department of Health, Philippines” Refusing to extend reproductive health care services and information on account of the patient’s civil status, gender or sexual orientation, age, religion, personal circumstances, and nature of work: Provided, that all conscientious objections of health care service providers based on religious grounds shall be respected: Provided, further, that the conscientious objector shall immediately refer the person seeking such care and services to another health care service provider within the same facility or one who is conveniently accessible: Provided, finally, that the patient is not in an emergency or serious case as defined in RA 8344 penalizing the refusal of hospitals and medical clinics to administer appropriate initial medical treatment and support in emergency and serious cases”. And also Borgen magazines stated that “Infant mortality rates in the Philippines have dropped from around 25 per 1,000 live births in 2010 to about 19 per 1,000 live births in 2020. Compared to 1950, the number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births in the Philippines has dropped almost 80% and is continuing to decrease. As for mothers, the maternal mortality rate has steadily been on the decline. It has decreased from 149 pregnancy-related deaths per 100,000 live births in 2009 to 121 women out of 100,000 in 2017.”, these studies prove a problem that needs to be addressed, time and time spent. to be fully accomplished. And according to the study of Mary Ann Jolley “We declared Puerto Princesa city a pro-life, pro-family city, which is really a harmless thing and I simply refused to allocate funds, specifically to buy contraceptives.” this is a study done directly right here in one of the Philippines. There is a lot of basis and basis on how to approach and resolve the problems we face. And these studies prove that we deserve to value every action we take for our health, community and nation.
